# scifioMavenTest



Make a simple project with a pom.xml that extends pom-scijava
Add a dependency on scijava-common.
Create a single concrete source class that extends AbstractService

Maven questions:
What command lists all the dependencies of the project?
What command downloads all the dependencies of the project to the target folder?
What is the difference between package and install in maven?


Stretch goals:
We're going to make a unit test that accesses your test class extending AbstractService
